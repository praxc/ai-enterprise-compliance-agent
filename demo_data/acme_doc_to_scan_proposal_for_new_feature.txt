2. Data Storage:
   - Customer data stored in plaintext JSON files for quick access
   - Files backed up to S3 bucket weekly
   - API key: "sk_live_abcd1234" (hardcoded in config.py)

3. Access:
   - Dashboard accessible via username/password
   - Sessions expire after 24 hours

4. Logging:
   - All user activities logged including email addresses for debugging
   - Logs stored indefinitely for analysis

DATA RETENTION:
- User data retained indefinitely for historical analysis
- No automated deletion process
